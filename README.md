#CodeFoo-2019

Hi This is my application for CodeFoo 2019. First of all I want to thank you for wonderfull challenge. It was real fun and learning doing all these challenges. All the answers and code are in designated folders. 

Following is the list of task completed:
Task1: Introduce yourself, explain your connection to IGN, and tell us why we should pick you to participate in IGN’s Code Foo program. Show your enthusiasm and passion for IGN in the form of a YouTube/Vimeo video, written document, audio track, or whatever format you feel most comfortable with.

Task2: Team Rocket is at it again! This time they are looking to terrorize the city of San Francisco, and aim to make the trek through the “crookedest street in the world” ( Lombard Street ) to steal a treasure contained in Coit Tower. Legend has it, the tower is completely filled with Poké Balls, enough Poké Balls for Team Rocket to amass an army of Pokémon! Fortunately, a slumbering Pokémon is known to sleep at the bottom of Lombard St and block the entrance to Coit Tower entirely. If Team Rocket determines how to wake the sleeping giant and successfully steals the cache of Poké Balls that fills Coit Tower, about how many Poké Balls would they walk away with? Describe each step in your thought process.

Task3: Create a program that will determine the armor set of the highest value based on Geralt’s available currency ( Crowns ). An armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type.
300 Crowns Available
You must be able to afford the total price of your armor set given your available Crowns
Each piece of armor contains a type, name, price, and armor value
Remember, an armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type
Inventory in Armorer’s shop provided
Display the final answer.
Explain how you implemented the solution. Is your solution successful with other inventories?

Task4: Back End:
Using this CSV, build a service to pull/read the content of the file, and store it in a MySQL database. Explain how are you storing, sanitizing, normalizing, and indexing the data.
Build a simple service you think would make sense that utilizes your database. Defend your proposals.


Thanks
